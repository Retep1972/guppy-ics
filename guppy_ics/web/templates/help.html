<h2>📘 PCAP Analysis Result – Help</h2>

<p>
This page explains how to interpret the results shown after uploading a PCAP file.
All analysis is <strong>passive</strong> and based only on <strong>observed network traffic</strong>
at the capture point.
</p>

<p class="muted">
Guppy ICS does not perform active scanning, probing, or fingerprinting.
Devices and communications not visible in the capture will not appear in the results.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>📊 Summary</h3>
<p>
The summary shows how many <strong>assets</strong>, <strong>communications</strong>,
and <strong>events</strong> were discovered during analysis.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>🧩 Assets</h3>
<p>
Assets represent discovered devices in the network.
A single asset may combine multiple identifiers (for example: MAC and IP address)
when identity linkage is observed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Label</strong>: Best available identifier (station name, IP address, or MAC)</li>
    <li><strong>Role</strong>: Inferred function (PLC, IO device, HMI, client, server)</li>
    <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: Industrial or management protocols the asset participates in</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility</strong>: How confidently the asset was observed (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Asset Visibility</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Observed (IP)</strong> –
        The device was directly observed communicating at the IP layer (TCP or UDP).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Observed (L2 only)</strong> –
        The device was directly observed at Ethernet level (for example PROFINET IO),
        but no IP traffic was seen.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inferred</strong> –
        The device was not directly observed communicating, but inferred from
        identity relationships or network structure.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
“Inferred” does not mean guessed or simulated – it indicates limited visibility
from the capture location.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>🔁 Communications</h3>
<p>
Communications describe how assets interact.
Each entry represents a <em>semantic communication relationship</em>,
not individual packets.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Protocol badge</strong>: Detected application protocol (e.g. S7, Modbus, OPC UA, SNMP, DNP3)</li>
    <li><strong>Function</strong>: Meaning of the traffic (client → server, controls, response, trap)</li>
    <li><strong>Direction</strong>: Source → Destination</li>
    <li><strong>IP and Ports</strong>: Shown when IP-based communication was observed</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
For Layer-2-only protocols (such as PROFINET IO), no IP addresses or ports are shown,
because they do not exist on the wire.
</p>

<hr>

<h4>Transport and OSI Layers</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>L2</strong>: Ethernet-based industrial traffic (e.g. PROFINET RT)</li>
    <li><strong>L3</strong>: Network layer (IP)</li>
    <li><strong>L4</strong>: Transport layer (TCP or UDP)</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
Guppy ICS prefers application-level protocols over raw transport information
to reduce noise and improve clarity.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>🗺️ Topology</h3>
<p>
The topology section provides a logical view of the network based on
observed communications.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each root node represents a source asset</li>
    <li>Indented entries show outgoing communication relationships</li>
    <li>Only the highest meaningful protocol is shown per relationship</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
The topology reflects observed communication paths, not physical cabling
or switch-level topology.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>⚠️ Events</h3>
<p>
Events highlight notable protocol-level observations when supported by a protocol.
Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Detection of insecure SNMP versions (v1 / v2c)</li>
    <li>Notable management or control behaviors</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
Not all protocols generate events.
Absence of events does not imply absence of risk.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>📄 Firewall Rule Export (CSV)</h3>
<p>
Guppy ICS can generate firewall rules based on observed IP-based communications.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Includes both <strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>UDP</strong> traffic</li>
    <li>Only includes assets directly <strong>observed at IP level</strong></li>
    <li>Uses observed source/destination IPs and ports</li>
    <li>Excludes Layer-2-only protocols and inferred assets</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
The firewall CSV represents what was observed in the PCAP.
It does not include assumed, inferred, or unseen communication paths.
Always validate rules in a test environment before deployment.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>🔐 Intended Use</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Gain situational awareness of ICS and OT networks</li>
    <li>Understand control, monitoring, and management traffic</li>
    <li>Support firewall and segmentation design</li>
    <li>Document brownfield industrial environments</li>
</ul>

<p class="muted">
Guppy ICS is designed to assist analysis and decision-making.
It does not replace engineering validation or safety review.
